We approached this assignment in a collaborative way, because we felt that this would ensure that our code worked cohesively. Our responsibilities are below: 

Qi Chen: Dashboard.py, status.py, displayuser.py, newfriends.py
Shammamah Hossain: CSS for all pages, HTML frontend for all pages, makefriends.py 
Yunus:register.c login.c seefriends.c

We would like to extend our gratitude to github (god bless), the GNU project (GNU bless), and Joseph Vybihal for his infinite love and support.
